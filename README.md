# Homura-Easy-Install-Script
This script installed the full KDE5 desktop and Homura so that you can game in FreeBSD with a single command.
To use it, simply download (wget) and execute the script from a new FreeBSD install.

NOTE: This is meant to be used in a virtual machine, since it does not install graphics drivers, but you can just install those if you want them. I might be adding some scripts here soon that will be used to install drivers and all so that one could install Homura and KDE5 on hardware.
